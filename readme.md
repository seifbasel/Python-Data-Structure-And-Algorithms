**Overview**

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms. The goal is to provide a practical understanding of these concepts through code examples.

**Data Structures**

The following data structures are covered in the repository:

* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)

**Algorithms**

The following algorithms are covered in the repository:

* Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
* Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
* Traversal Algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)

* **Books:**
    * Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein
    * Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

**Getting Started**

To get started, you can clone the repository and run the provided Python scripts. 

**Additional Notes**

the repository is a work in progress and that new data structures and algorithms will be added over time.
